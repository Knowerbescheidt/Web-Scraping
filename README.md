# Web Scraping Example
This is a small training example, I did in my free time. I used beautifulsoup, and requests packages also I wanted to use pandas, currently i encounter a problem with pandas and numpy on windows. https://tinyurl.com/y3dm3h86

## Source
The website I scraped is a fake only bookstore especially designed for training to scrape webpages.

## Progress
I scraped all pages for titles, prices, availability and rating information. All this information is stored in dictionary which in a further process should be transformed to a dataframe and written into an excel.

If you have comments or recommendations just let me know. :)
